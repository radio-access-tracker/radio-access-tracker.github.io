# Radio Access Tracker

Let's collection data about the coverage of cellular reception and blame our mobile network providers. 

## Idea

The basic idea is to build apps that read the radio access status or cellular reception and let the user send it together with the current location and a timestamp to some backend. Once a significant amount of data all sorts of visualization frontend can be build based on the data. The original idea is to have some website that shows a headmap with the coverage types overlaying a map.
